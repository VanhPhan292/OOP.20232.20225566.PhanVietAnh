Advantages of Polymorphism:
Code Reusability
Flexibility
Extensibility
Abstraction

Inheritance and Polymorphism:
Inheritance is a mechanism where you can derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.

Differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to acquire the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class.
Polymorphism, on the other hand, allows us to perform a single action in different ways. It provides the ability to a message to be displayed in more than one form.
